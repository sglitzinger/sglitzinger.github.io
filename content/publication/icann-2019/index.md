abstract: A neural networkâ€™s topology greatly influences its generalization ability.
  Many approaches to topology optimization employ heuristics, for example genetic
  algorithms, oftentimes consuming immense computational resources. In this contribution,
  we present a genetic algorithm for network topology optimization which can be deployed
  effectively in low-resource settings. To this end, we utilize the TensorFlow framework
  for network training and operate with several techniques reducing the computational
  load. The genetic algorithm is subsequently applied to the MNIST image classification
  task in two different scenarios.
