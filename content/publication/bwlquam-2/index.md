abstract: A social network (SN) is a group of actors and their mutual relations. Sociologists
  try to answer the question why networked actors in our society aremore successful
  than others and how this networking works. Directed or undirected graphs, hyper-
  or multigraphs are a suitable means to visualize social relations. Social networks
  with directed and weighted links among actors need sophisticated instruments for
  analyses. We model these links as probabilistic conditioned propositions. Then for
  any actor i the model permits the estimation of transfer probabilities to all actors
  j, may they be linked to i or not. When future sociological research wants to interconnect
  missing links, some of the respective weights cannot be chosen at will but must
  fall in certain intervals. They must be in accordance with former conditional-logical
  net structure. To achieve this goal, cross-entropy-driven knowledge bases are applied.
  For a middle-size network we demonstrate the new findings.
