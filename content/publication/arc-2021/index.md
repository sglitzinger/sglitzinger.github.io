abstract: Design space exploration can be used to find a power-efficient architectural
  design for a given application, such as the best suited configuration of a heterogeneous
  system from soft cores of different types, given area and throughput constraints.
  We show how to integrate design space exploration into a static scheduling algorithm
  for a streaming task graph application with parallelizable tasks and solve the resulting
  combined optimization problem by an integer linear program (ILP). We demonstrate
  the improvements by our strategy with ARM big and LITTLE soft cores and synthetic
  task graphs.
