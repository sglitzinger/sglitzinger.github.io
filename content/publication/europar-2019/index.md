abstract: We consider temperature-aware, energy-efficient scheduling of streaming
  applications with parallelizable tasks and throughput requirement on multi-/many-core
  embedded devices with discrete dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). Given
  the few available discrete frequency levels, we provide the task schedule in a conservative
  and a relaxed form so that using them adaptively decreases power consumption, i.e.
  lowers chip temperature, without hurting throughput in the long run. We support
  our proposal by a toolchain to compute the schedules and evaluate the power reduction
  with synthetic task sets.
