abstract: Higher-radix floating-point representations have the potential for higher
  performance, lower energy footprint, and reduced gate count in embedded systems
  when compared to traditional binary floating-point numbers. Thus, they might also
  appear in transmission of sensor data values. However, these number formats introduce
  redundancies, which can be exploited for steganographic message transfer. We present
  a covert channel that exploits this redundancy and can trade steganographic bandwidth
  against introduced error and thus detectability. In the basic variant, the covert
  channel is fully reversible, i.e., not detectable from the data. Experiments with
  an implementation illustrate that detectability via compressibility metric, Shannon
  entropy and bi-grams is possible depending on how aggressive bandwidth is pushed.
