abstract: We investigate decimal number representations in large data streams. When
  decimal numbers are encoded in bits, not all possibilities are used. This opens
  possibilities to establish a covert channel, i.e., to inject secret data into the
  data stream and transport it hidden in the mass of data, which poses a security
  risk, as covert channels are mostly used for criminal purposes. We present a novel
  covert channel approach for streams of decimal data, a field which so far has been
  neglected. Moreover, we sketch an application scenario and analyze the covert channel's
  detectability, in particular how detectability and steganographic bandwidth can
  be traded against each other. The approach and proposals for detection are tested
  via simulation experiments.
