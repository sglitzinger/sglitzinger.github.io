abstract: We consider static scheduling of parallelizable tasks onto machines with
  frequency scaling for the case that not all tasks can be executed prior to a deadline.
  We model this scenario from a HPC cluster operator's perspective. We solve the combinatorial
  optimization problem to maximize the operator's profit by integer linear programming
  and by a heuristic. We evaluate the heuristic with synthetic benchmark task sets
  and demonstrate that it achieves at most 20% less profit than the solution via linear
  programming, so that it can be used for large task sets where the latter is not
  feasible anymore.
