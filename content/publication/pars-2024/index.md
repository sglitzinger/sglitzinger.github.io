abstract: We investigate fast compression algorithms for vectors of floating-point values, as these
  frequently appear in numerical computations. Our proposal bases on Snappy yet uses a modified data
  layout. Use of data chunks allows parallel thread-based compression without loss of compression
  quality. Our proposal beats previous proposals and standard compression algorithms in compression
  ratio and/or speed. The gain in compression ratio and speed can be used to shorten communication
  phases, e.g., between CPUs and accelerators.
