abstract: Abstract Terrorism is a scourge of humanity. Thousands of people were killed
  by terrorists in the last years. To understand the structure, information flow and
  leadership in terrorist cells is a must for all societies to prevent future attacks.
  Network theory can help to model such cells and to identify leading members therein.
  This contribution uses the graph theoretical approach as a basis and enriches it
  by an entropy-driven knowledge processing. After presenting the theoretical concept
  two terrorist cells, the one of the Bali attack and the one of the 9/11 attack,
  are analysed. The results are compared to those of other methods. A preview on the
  application of weighted networks and multi-nets complements the new findings.
