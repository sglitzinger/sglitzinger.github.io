abstract: Real-time applications often take the form of streaming applications, where
  a stream of inputs such as camera images is processed by an application represented
  as a task graph. The workload together with the required throughput often necessitates
  processing on a multicore system and also demands parallelization of large tasks.
  We extend a scheduling algorithm for such applications, originally devised to handle
  varying task workloads, to also cover varying core count, e.g. caused by failure
  of a core. We use frequency scaling to accelerate processing when the necessity
  to re-execute tasks from the crashed core arises, to maintain throughput. We evaluate
  the algorithm by scheduling synthetic task graphs that represent corner cases and
  a real streaming application.
