abstract: 'A special type of social networks is the so-called affiliation network,
  consisting of two modes of vertices: actors and events. Up to now, in the undirected
  case, the closeness of actors in such networks has been measured by their jointly-attended
  events. Indirect contacts and attenuated and directed links are of minor interest
  in affiliation networks. These flaws make a veritable estimation of, e.g., possible
  message transfers amongst actors questionable. In this contribution, first, we discuss
  these matters from a graph-theoretical point of view. Second, so as to avoid the
  identified weaknesses, we propose an up-and-coming entropy-based approach for modeling
  such networks in their generic structure, replacing directed (attenuated) links
  by conditionals: if-then. In this framework, the contribution of actors and events
  to a reliable message transfer from one actor to another -- even via intermediaries
  -- is then calculated applying the principle of maximum entropy. The usefulness
  of this new approach is demonstrated by the analysis of an affiliation network called
  “corporate directors”.'
