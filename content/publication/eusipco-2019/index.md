abstract: We extend static scheduling of parallelizable tasks to machines with multiple
  core types, taking differences in performance and power consumption due to task
  type into account. Next to energy minimization for given deadline, i.e. for given
  throughput requirement, we consider makespan minimization for given energy or average
  power budgets. We evaluate our approach by comparing schedules of synthetic task
  sets for big.LITTLE with other schedulers from literature. We achieve an improvement
  of up to 33%.
