abstract: Crown scheduling is a static scheduling approach for sets of parallelizable
  tasks with a common deadline, aiming to minimize energy consumption on parallel
  processors with frequency scaling. We demonstrate that crown schedules are robust,
  i.e. that the runtime prolongation of one task by a moderate percentage does not
  cause a deadline transgression by the same fraction. In addition, by speeding up
  some tasks scheduled after the prolonged task, the deadline can still be met at
  a moderate additional energy consumption. We present a heuristic to perform this
  re-scaling online. We evaluate our approach with scheduling experiments on synthetic
  task sets.
