abstract: We introduce a novel approach for energy-efficient scheduling of data-dependent
  stream programs with packet types on multicore architectures with voltage and frequency
  scaling. To have the given application meet specific throughput demands while minimizing
  energy consumption, we enhance the existing crown scheduling by packet-type dependent
  parameters. Formulation as an integer linear program generates a parametric, multi-scenario
  crown schedule for table-driven execution. By inspecting the packet stream at runtime,
  our online scheduler selects the appropriate schedule and handles frequency levels.
  The performance of our technique is compared to crown scheduling with synthetic
  stream programs. Our results demonstrate an average energy reduction of 23.94%.
