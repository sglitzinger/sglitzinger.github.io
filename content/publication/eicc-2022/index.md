abstract: Network authentication frequently relies on nonces, and even widely deployed
  protocols still rely on random nonces, although they might enable kleptography attacks.
  Notably, for TLS a kleptography-based covert channel has been published, and despite
  a proposal to cure this weakness via controlled randomness including backward compatibility,
  the protocol description is not updated. We investigate if lack of bandwidth, i.e.,
  lack of applicability, could be a reason not to care for such an update. Moreover,
  we give examples of other authentication protocols that might suffer from a similar
  weakness, and that possibly might profit from a similar cure, thus indicating necessity
  of further research.
